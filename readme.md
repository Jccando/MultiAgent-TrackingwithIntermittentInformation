(1) 前期的理论介绍与简单验证对应论文已投稿于第三届空天前沿大会AFC,即信息形式卡尔曼滤波与NLMS滤波(均嵌入博弈效用函数)在估计效果的比较；

(2) 后期的理论证明与仿真实验对应论文将投稿于IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering(T-ASE)期刊,即博弈效用的嵌入与基于协同信息自适应调整的NLMS滤波不会改变联合连通性与协同信息条件的满足、仿真实验即采用人工势场模拟多智能体追踪目标可抵抗智能体受遮挡的影响与新目标加入智能体仍能均衡分配智能体。

欢迎star并持续关注进程，后续还会有实机的实验验证环节～

The affiliated unit of this project is the Aerospace College (Aerospace Science and Technology Institute) of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

(1) The preliminary theoretical introduction and simple verification corresponding to this paper have been submitted to the 3rd Aerospace Frontier Conference AFC, namely the comparison of the estimation effects of information-based Kalman filtering and NLMS filtering (both embedded with game utility functions);

(2) The subsequent theoretical proof and simulation experiments will be submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (T-ASE) journal. The paper will discuss the embedding of game utility and the NLMS filtering based on adaptive adjustment of collaborative information, which will not affect the joint connectivity and the satisfaction of the collaborative information conditions. The simulation experiments will use artificial potential fields to simulate multi-agent tracking of targets, and will show that the agents can resist the influence of occlusion and still achieve balanced distribution of agents when a new target is added. 

Welcome to star and keep following the progress. There will also be a hands-on experimental verification session later on～
